THis Assignment 4 folder has 3 python files, cfr_map.ipynb, data_process.ipynb, 
and white_wash.ipynb and README.txt and lastly it has Source_data_for_CFR_vaccine_map_abirdged.csv

For the cfr_map.ipynb, to get radius of circle, I used the ratio of 40*current#of cases/largest#ofcase. I used 40  because It is the best fit.
